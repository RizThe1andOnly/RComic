																Progress Document
Keep track of what is going on with this project and what has to be done.

----- 3/11/2021 -----

Current Progress:
	
	ResourceGetter class is completed but still needs to be tested. It reads all of the files in the downloads directory
	and copy those files into a folder into the local directory. So now should be able to read any of those files without having
	to copy them. (keep this in mind!!!) Also know that ResourceGetter makes the temp directory available as a property, so the
	driver class can give it to other classes to do work with.

TODO:

^^^	Start working on ResourceLoader and its children classes. These classes should have access to the temp directory that holds the 
	copied versions of the cbr files, those files have open access as they are already copied into the local directory. So what
	ResourceLoader and its children have to do is to simply open those files and process their contents for their purposes (hopefully).

Ideation:
	- Currently ResourceGetter() has made all comics available to ResourceLoader, so how to process the data?
	A method to open the zip and an abstract method to process each entry based on the type of loader. Check if
	abstract method can be called from within a non-abstract one.

Current Progress:
	Changed the direction of the app execution but have not yet fully implemented the changes. The new plan will involve copying the cbr files
	to the temporary directory as mention in 3/11/2021 section, then simply passing the instance of that newly created StorageFolder to carry out
	different tasks. 

	The ComicMetadataLoader will receive the temporary directory created and then go through each cbr file to obtain its xml file. This has been 
	for the most part implemented but not yet tested. Progress has reached the point where the entry corresponding to the xml file is obtained.
	Now what remains is to create the ComicMetadata object by calling the corresponding class constructor. It should be noted, to do this, first
	the ComicMetadata class needs to be completed.

	ComicMetada class is under progress right now. It can currently create the xml StorageFolder object given the rar entry object (from SharpCompress).
	Now for the application, the StorageFolder needs to be read using the System.XML library. Read the TODO for more.

TODO:
	Complete the xml reading of the ComicMetadata class. Need to look up the way to extract data from an xml file. Then need to implement
	the means by which to extract data.
